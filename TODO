# To do list:

- [X] Sample in the triangle not just on
- [ ] Add stronger unit tests for AAA when clean up function is used
- [X] Add different modes for what function AAA should approximate
- [X] Implement Delves and Lyness
- [ ] Implement Kravanja and Barel
- [X] Detect zeros on the boundary by looking at the magnitude of f(z) rather than doing
      extra quadrature - not needed in the end just removed unnecessary integration
- [ ] Newton method to polish / subdivide if not matching
- [X] Update sampling experiment to include how accurate is the computed pole, how accurate
      is the computed approximation, also consider a holomorphic function
- [ ] Implement numerical differentiation using 2.7 of https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/publication/PDF/2014_148.pdf
- [X] Use a harder function in the subdivision experiment
- [X] investigate reference problem 6 in poles_and_zeros.ipynb
