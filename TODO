# To do list:

- [ ] Sample in the triangle not just on
- [ ] Add stronger tests for AAA
- [ ] Add different modes for what function AAA should approximate
- [ ] Implement Delves and Lyness
- [ ] Implement Kravanja and Barel
- [ ] Detect zeros on the boundary by looking at the magnitude of f(z) rather than doing
      extra quadrature
- [ ] Newton method to polish / subdivide if not matching
- [ ] Update sampling experiment to include how accurate is the computed pole, how accurate
      is the computed approximation, also consider a holomorphic function
